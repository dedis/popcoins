\subsubsection*{Acknowledgements}

\paragraph{}
We would like to express our special thanks to Linus Gasser who gave us the opportunity to do this very interesting project related to the collective authority (Cothority) framework developed by the DeDiS laboratory at EPFL. We would like to thank him for the valuable help he gave us whenever we needed and for the knowledge he provided to us throughout the semester.
Secondly, we would also like to thank our parents and friends who helped us through the hard times of finalising the project within the limited time frame.
