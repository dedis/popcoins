\subsection*{Acknowledgments}
I would like to thank Linus Gasser who gave me the chance to do this project. I would also like to thank him for the help he provided me all along the semester, which gave me the confidence to go through the different challenges this project imposed. Beside giving me a lot of new knowledge on  cryptography subjects , this project strengthens my belief of continuing my studies in the field of decentralized technologies. I would also like to thank Gaurav Gnarula, in charge of the CothorityJS and KyberJS modules, who provides me a valuable help to resolve the bugs related to their execution in the NativeScript environment. Finally, I would like to thank the \textit{Blockchain Society}\footnote{\url{https://blockchainsociety.ch}} for their patience during the two sessions of real-world testing of CP-MAC.
