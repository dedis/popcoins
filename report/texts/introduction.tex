\section{Introduction}
In this report, I will present the work that has been done on the CP-MAC cross-platform mobile application. CP-MAC allows a user to use the framework Cothority, developed at the DEDIS lab, in a functional and user-friendly application. The base application containing all the primitives to use the framework was already done during a previous semester project, thus the focus in this project was to improve the user experience and to extend the application with a new functionality. The chosen functionality is the BeerCoin, a long time running joke at the DEDIS lab which consists of beer tokens that can be distributed in a group using Proof-Of-Personhood. A token can then be used to get a beer and the barman can cryptographically verify if this token is part of the allowed group and unused.
